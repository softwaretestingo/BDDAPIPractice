{
"message":"Softwaretestingo";
}

If you want to pass this JSON then we can do this by:

1. We Can send directly by Providing special character in string
2. JSON Using HashMap
3. Send JSON From any external file
4. By Creating Java Object Out Of it(POJO - Plain Object Java Classes)

POJO Classes
----------------
{
    "name": "Softwaretestingo",
    "job": "Admin"
}

In the above JSON name and job is Key and Softwaretestingo & Admin is Value.
So For Each Key create a Variable. And for that variable Create two methods which is getter and setter
